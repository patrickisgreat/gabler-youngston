  Every space has been lit with intention and thought. The chapel defines
  simplicity with candles, cove lighting, and a single downlight at the altar.
  In the sanctuary, the peaked ceiling is subtly illuminated, providing a warm
  and comfortable backdrop for the more traditional pendants in the space.
