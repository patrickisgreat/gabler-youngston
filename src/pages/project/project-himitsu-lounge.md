      Every space has been lit with intention and thought. One room showcases
      candle-shaped lights to give the impression of a community vigil, invoking
      religious, reverent feelings. And in the sanctuary, the modern vaulted
      ceiling is illuminated to call attention upward in wonder, while hanging
      lanterns complete the theme of medieval religious architecture in a modern
      way.
