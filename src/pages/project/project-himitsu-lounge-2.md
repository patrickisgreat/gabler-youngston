  This invitation-only speakeasy exemplifies refined luxury. While it certainly
  helps to set the mood, the mild, broad-spectrum lighting also helps bring out
  the bold, dark colors of the furniture and fittings.

      Rich gem colors in velvet and leather, dark mahogany woods and an
      under-lit bar inspire a feeling of richness. The way light peaks from the
      negative spaces in Himitsu highlights the focal points of the space.
