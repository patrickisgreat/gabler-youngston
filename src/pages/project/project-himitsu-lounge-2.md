      This speakeasy style bar and lounge has a very early industrial look that
      makes low lighting a requirement. While it certainly helps to set the
      mood, the mild, broad-spectrum lighting also helps bring out the bold,
      dark colors of the furniture and fixtures.

      Rich gem colors in velvet and leather, dark mahogany woods and an underlit
      bar inspire a feeling of richness. The way light peaks from the negative
      spaces in Himitsu does best to highlight the focal points of the space.
