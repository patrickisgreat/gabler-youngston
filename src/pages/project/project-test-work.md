      Each area of the facility, from the gym and locker room to the lobby and
      balcony, has its own unique lighting. By combining old and new styles,
      warm and cool light tones, and considering available natural light in the
      design, the lighting ensures that the athletes at the Atlanta United
      Practice Facility get to experience both the energizing and relaxing
      effects they need in their space.
