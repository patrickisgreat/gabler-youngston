      This 48-story skyscraper uses clever colored lighting to become an
      exceptional and beautiful part of the Charlotte, North Carolina skyline,
      and highlight the angular architecture of the building. Plus, because Duke
      Energy is an electricity provider, the light design showcases their
      commitment to sustainable and progressive electric lighting at a scale
      that can’t be missed.

      The project was the first large scale installation of color changing
      facade lighting in the Southeast United States and has become a cultural
      icon in the city, counting down the New Years Eve clock and celebrating
      the home team’s touchdowns, among other festive activities.
