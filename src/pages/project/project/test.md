      The Bacardi Headquarters features daylight-bright lighting in a way that
      speaks to the professionalism of the company while imitating their
      tropical Cuban origin. The lounge within the headquarters features cooler
      blue and violet hues that allow visitors to experience the Bacardi product
      in what feels like its natural environment.
