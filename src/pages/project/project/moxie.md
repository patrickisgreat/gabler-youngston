      The sheer size and variety of locations within this luxury hotel demand
      just as many lighting styles to match. While the lobby, hallways, and
      event space offer stunning chandeliers and sconce-topped columns,
      individual rooms are sectioned by home-style lamps and inspiring fixtures
      placed strategically to match the furnishings.
