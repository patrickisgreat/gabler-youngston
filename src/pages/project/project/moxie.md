      While the lobby, hallways, and event space offer stunning chandeliers and
      sconce-topped columns, individual rooms are sectioned by home-style lamps
      and inspiring fixtures placed strategically to match the furnishings. The
      various bars, patios, and gyms are also styled with lighting variations to
      match their designs so that visitors can take a sort of journey just by
      visiting.
