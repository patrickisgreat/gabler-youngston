      This unfinished-ceiling office space lighting is casual and consistent
      with the visible ductwork, with long hanging LED lights that provide a
      functional and vibe improvement on a typical loftâ€™s utilitarian
      fluorescent light fixtures.

      Workstations and walkways have a little extra but unobtrusive tactical
      lighting, while the conference and common spaces get the total brightness
      of traditional drop ceiling lighting in a softer, more diffuse deployment.
