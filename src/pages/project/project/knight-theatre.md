      Stage performance venues call for soft, subtle lighting, which is what the
      Knight Theatre showcases. While some lights are displayed in interesting
      patterns, much of the illumination is more about where the light lands
      than the source of it.

      While there are many functional and aesthetic benefits to the lighting in
      the Knight Theatre, the lighting draws the direction of attention
      naturally towards the stage. The theatre is an integral part of the
      Charlotte cultural campus.
