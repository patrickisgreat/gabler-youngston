      Stage performance venues call for soft, subtle lighting, which is what the
      Knight Theatre showcases.

      While some lights are displayed in interesting patterns, much of the
      illumination is more about where the light lands than the source of it.
      And while there are many functional and aesthetic benefits to the lighting
      in the Knight Theatre, the lighting draws the direction of attention
      naturally towards the stage.
