      The lighting design gives off a certain sense of sophistication and
      creativity thatâ€™s both prestigious for the school and inspiring for
      students. By contrast, the lecture hall appears lively and bright while
      not being distracting or fatiguing, with linear lights subtly directing
      attention towards the front of the presentation and lecture space.
