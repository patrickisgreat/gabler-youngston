      Whether itâ€™s in the museum-like displays, functional walkways, or
      energizing dining hall, the lighting has the same attention to detail as
      the architecture and the cars within the facility. And while subtle, the
      lighting even calls to mind styles common to both automotive and
      construction for a unified theme.
