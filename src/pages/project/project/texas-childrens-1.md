      The magic of crafting lighting for Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital is that the
      facility must also feel safe, relaxing, and even playful for young
      patients, and the lighting was crafted to do exactly that. The glowing
      orbs in the atrium were carefully studied for lighting placement to create
      a radiant glow.
