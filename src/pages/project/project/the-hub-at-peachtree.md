  The revamped space will be called The Hub, a nod to Peachtree Center's
  position at the heart of Downtown and its connectivity, walkability and
  energy. The retail center will evolve into The Hub, which debuted in spring
  2019, bringing new food offerings and experiences to Downtown Atlanta.

      Design principles of daylighting, public art, and “green” elements were
      integrated into an accessible, cohesively designed retail environment that
      provides a comfortable respite from the busy downtown streets. Ultimately,
      the project resulted in the revitalization of a downtown Atlanta landmark
      that, while once at the center of the urban environment, had long since
      been forgotten and replaced by new public areas.
