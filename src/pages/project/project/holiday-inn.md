      The home-style decor is best supported by conventional but creative lamps
      and hanging fixtures in thoughtful, comforting arrangements that also
      allow for the space to seamlessly transition from dining space in the
      morning to lounge space at night. This prototype project serves as the
      exemplar for all future Holiday Inn new construction and renovation
      projects.
