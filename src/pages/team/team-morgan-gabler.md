  Morgan has always been passionate about helping bring a collaborative vision
  to life through lighting. For her, this started with theater and working in
  various lighting design firms before it manifested in co-founding
  Gabler-Youngston.




  Now, Morgan and her team are dedicated to showing that lighting design isn’t
  work, it’s a work of art. No matter how many projects she’s completed, Morgan
  still feels personally invested in the quality of each job and how happy the
  client is in the outcome. Lighting design is an art and a craft, but for
  Morgan, the real skill and talent is in making the client’s vision come to
  life.


  Morgan is a Professional Member of the International Association of Lighting
  Designers (IALD) and has been the IALD Awards Chairperson from 2017 through
  2020. She was president of the Georgia Section of the Illuminating Engineering
  Society of North America (IESNA) in 2002-2003 and Regional Vice President for
  the Southern Region of the IESNA from 2007-2008. She also served on the
  Consultant Advisory Committee to GE Industrial from 2003-2007. She served as a
  Regional Coordinator for the IALD from 2007-2012.


  Morgan presented the Lightfair Innovation Awards at Lightfair 2007. She has
  also seen her work published in numerous trade journals, including recent
  articles on retail illumination and light pollution in Architectural Lighting
  and Professional Lighting Design magazines. Morgan has received six
  International Illumination Design Awards, an Edison Award of Merit and an
  Edison Award for Sustainable Design.
