title: JIM YOUNGSTON
designation: Principal
description: >-
  James Youngston, co-founder of Gabler-Youngston, discovered his talent in the
  lighting industry in stage theater and production. After working with various
  theater and architectural lighting design organizations, James set out to
  create a company based around his expert vision and core values for lighting
  design.




  The driving principle for James is that lighting should be seamless with the
  rest of a facility and complement its design, not distract attention away from
  it. A user in a space shouldn’t notice the lighting specifically unless
  there’s a reason to. While excellent lighting design is certainly artistic,
  James believes that lighting designers should approach their projects
  practically, humbly, and collaboratively.




  Because of his unique approach to unobtrusive design, James has a special
  talent for finding more suitable and unique designs that might be missed for
  more obvious options with other designers.




  James is a Professional Member of the International Association of Lighting
  Designers (IALD) and Lighting Certified (LC) by the National Council for
  Qualifications for the Lighting Professional (NCQLP). He served on the Board
  of Directors of the Georgia Section of the Illuminating Engineering Society of
  North America (IESNA) from 2000-2007 and as Section President in 2004-2005. He
  served on the Membership Committee of the IALD from 2007-2009 and on the IALD
  Board of Directors as Membership Chair from 2010-2013.




  He has been recognized with thirteen Sectional and International Illumination
  Design Awards and has seen his work and articles in a wide variety of
  publications such as Architectural Record, Professional Lighting Design, Mondo
  Arc, Metropolitan Home, and the Atlanta Journal Constitution. He has received
  an Edison Award of Merit and an Edison Award for Sustainable Design. Jim has
  also spoken at various trade shows, professional society meetings, and at The
  Savannah College of Art and Design and The University of Colorado, Boulder,
  among others.
