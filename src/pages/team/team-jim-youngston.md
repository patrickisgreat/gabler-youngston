title: JIM YOUNGSTON
designation: Principal
description: >-
  James Youngston, co-founder of Gabler-Youngston, discovered his talent in the
  lighting industry in stage theater and production. After working with various
  theater and architectural lighting design organizations, James set out to
  create a company based around his expert vision and core values for lighting
  design.


  The driving principle for James is that lighting should be seamless with the
  rest of a facility and complement its design. A user in a space shouldn’t
  notice the lighting specifically unless there’s a reason to do so. While
  architectural lighting design is certainly an artistic endeavor, James
  believes that lighting designers should approach their projects practically,
  humbly, and collaboratively.


  Because of his approach to design, James has a talent for finding bespoke
  approaches that might be otherwise overlooked.


  James is a Professional Member of the International Association of Lighting
  Designers (IALD) and Lighting Certified (LC) by the National Council for
  Qualifications for the Lighting Professional (NCQLP). He served on the Board
  of Directors of the Georgia Section of the Illuminating Engineering Society of
  North America (IESNA) from 2000-2007 and as Section President in 2004-2005. He
  served on the Membership Committee of the IALD from 2007-2009 and on the IALD
  Board of Directors as Membership Chair from 2010-2013.


  He has been recognized with thirteen Sectional and International Illumination
  Design Awards and has seen his work and articles in a wide variety of
  publications such as Architectural Record, Professional Lighting Design, Mondo
  Arc, Metropolitan Home, and the Atlanta Journal Constitution. He has received
  an Edison Award of Merit and an Edison Award for Sustainable Design. James has
  also spoken at various trade shows, professional society meetings, and at The
  Savannah College of Art and Design and The University of Colorado, Boulder,
  among others.
