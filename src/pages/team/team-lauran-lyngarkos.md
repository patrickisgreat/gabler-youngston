title: LAUREN LYNGARKOS
designation: Philidelphia Lead
description: >-
  Lauren started her lighting career in theater and other live performance
  settings for lighting design. In graduate school, Lauren worked on a lighting
  design project for a museum, and after that first permanent installation, she
  was hooked. After graduate school, Lauren decided to move away from theater,
  but stick with lighting design as her passion, working instead in architecture
  lighting design.


  For Lauren, the key to great results is knowing that people are going to be
  moving in their space, and that the lighting isnâ€™t just about illuminating the
  walls and fixtures and furniture. Lighting in motion should tell a story.


  Overall, her projects demonstrate that good lighting is humble but powerful.
