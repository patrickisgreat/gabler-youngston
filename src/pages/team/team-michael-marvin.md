title: MICHAEL MARVIN
designation: International Lead & Designer
description: >-
  Michael’s passion for connecting lighting with the surrounding structure
  started while he attended Southern Polytechnic State University to study
  architecture. Because of his natural talent for architecture and lighting
  design, Michael’s professor strongly recommended him for an internship with
  Gabler Youngston. Once on board, Michael fit in perfectly and delivered great
  results for clients, and thus became a permanent member of the Gabler
  Youngston team.


  While on the job, Michael loves that he gets to be creative and work on
  projects that are meaningful to the communities who experience and see his
  work. In industry terms, Michael is able to “see” light, and has the ability
  to recognize the first and second order effects of lighting that even clients
  may not be able to envision in their own space.


  Michael invests a lot of thought into the wellbeing of Gabler Youngston’s
  clients, thinking of good design as conducive to health and life. That means
  providing the best lighting solution for the occupants of the space and its
  usage. If spaces have truly thoughtful lighting, the people working, living,
  or visiting in the spaces are more productive, feel better, and want to stay
  there, which synergizes with every client’s goals.
