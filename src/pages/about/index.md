    Lighting design studies the interactions of volume, materials, user needs,
    and illumination. A successful design responds to and reinforces
    architectural elements without overwhelming them.As partners, Morgan and Jim
    respond to the needs of clients through a collaborative process. We work
    with designers and owners as our collaborators to create an aesthetically
    pleasing, practically functional design that is also maintenance and budget
    friendly. Ours is an encompassing approach interconnecting all the pieces of
    the architectural puzzle, and resulting in a truly integrated design.
